# Localization

[[toc]]

Fjord can be managed multilingual. The translation in the frontend can be done in `php` using [laravel's localization](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/localization) service or in `vue` using [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/docs/formatting.html). It uses the syntax of **laravel**. All translation strings are formatted so they can be used in `vue-i18n` as well.

In Laravel applications that include Fjord, there are **two** different locales, one for your website and one for the Fjord application. So for example, a user can manage German content in the Fjord application and still see the interface in the English version.

The following examples refer to the translations which look like this:

```php
// fjord/resources/lang/{locale}/messages.php

return [
    "welcome": "Welcome, :name"
];
```

## PHP

To compile for the locale of the Fjord interface the `__f()` helper method is used, just like `__()` from laravel's [localization](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/localization#retrieving-translation-strings).

```php
__f('messages.welcome', ['name', 'Jannes'])
```

Pluralization can be used with the `__f_choice` function or the short version `__f_c`.

```php
'apples' => '{0} There are none|[1,19] There are some|[20,*] There are many',

...

__f_choice('apples', 10)
__f_c('apples', 10)
```

## Vue

In `Vue` the [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/introduction.html) format is used.

```javascript
<template>
    <div>
        {{ $t('messages.welcome', { name: 'Jannes' }) }}
    </div>
</template>
```

::: tip
You can also use the Larvel localization helpers in Vue components.

-   \_\_()
-   trans()
-   trans_choice()

## Determine Locale

To determine the locale the function `getLocale` can be used on the `FjordApp` facade like this:

```php
$fjordLocale = FjordApp::getLocale();

if (FjordApp::isLocale('en')) {
    //
}
```

## Add Path

By default the path `fjord/resources/lang` is imported for the Fjord translation. You can register any number of paths with localization files in your service providers. However, it is recommended to keep the translations for the Fjord application and your website separate.

All translation attributes are merged, which makes it easy to extend existing localizations for parts like **validation** or others.

```php
use Fjord\Support\Facades\FjordLang;

FjordLang::addPath(base_path('yourpath/lang/'));
```
